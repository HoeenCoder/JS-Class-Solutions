# Pokemon Showdown & Javascript Class Solutions
This repository contains the solutions for assignments I have given in my [Pokemon Showdown & JavaScript Class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iqDhegUbfrQ-WQa6o10SLQzfMx3LruY0dj78GeT0lNk/edit). The repository itself is the solution for day 4's assignment. Please note that your answers may vary from mine, and that is OK. There are multiple ways to program an assignment. Students, please continue to submit your assignments to me for review so I can offer advice on good styling and code practices, as well as help fix any issues your code may have.

## Day 4's assignment
When doing day 4's assignment, **do not fork this repository**. Instead, create your own using both git on your computer, and github.
